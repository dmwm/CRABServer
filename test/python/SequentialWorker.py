""" This worker can be used for testing purposes. Just run:
         "python SequentialWorker.py /path/to/config"
    and have fun!
    
    More details: it instantiates the MasterWorker with the TEST flag True. This makes the MasterWorker
    sequential (it does not instantiate new threads) and the logging is done at the console and not on
    a file.
