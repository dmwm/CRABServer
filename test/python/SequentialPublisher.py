""" This worker can be used for testing purposes. Just run:
         "python SequentialPublisher.py /path/to/config"
    and have fun!
    If you want to immedately start a pdb session add a 2nd argument (any word will do)
         "python SequentialPublisher.py /path/to/config d"

    More details: it instantiates the Publisher Worker with the TEST flag True. This makes the Worker
    sequential (it does not instantiate new threads) and the logging is done at the console and not on
    a file.
