INTRODUCTION 

This directory provides some simple tests for TaskWorker.

These are not really unit tests - they require a valid grid proxy to run and
they connect to a real schedd for the HTCondor submit.

REQUIREMENTS

These were tested on a RHEL6 development machine.

They require the following checkouts inside $CRAB3_CHECKOUT:

- CRABServer: git@github.com:bbockelm/CRABServer.git (branch dagman)
- CAFTaskWorker: git@github.com:bbockelm/CAFTaskWorker.git (branch dagman)
- CAFUtilities: git@github.com:bbockelm/CAFUtilities.git (branch dagman)
- WMCore: git@github.com:bbockelm/WMCore.git (branch crab3)
- DBS: git@github.com:bbockelm/DBS.git (branch dagman)

(and $CRAB3_CHECKOUT to be set to the appropriate directory).  As we
merge the branches into dmwm github and git.cern.ch, the branches and
git locations mentioned above will change.

USAGE

To run all tests:

$ ./test/bin/bootstrap_tw_unit.sh

To run a specific test:

$ ./test/bin/bootstrap_tw_unit.sh -v TestActionHandler.testSubmitNewHTCondorTask

To run pylint on a directory:

$ ./test/bin/bootstrap_pylint.sh src/python/TaskWorker/Actions/DagmanSubmitter.py

We generally look for something in the 7+ range on pylint
